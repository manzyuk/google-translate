;;; Commentary:

;; Invoking the function `google-translate-query-translate' queries the source
;; and target languages and text to translate, and shows a buffer with
;; available translations of the text.  Invoking the function
;; `google-translate-at-point' translates the word at point or the active
;; region.

;; Installation:

;; Assuming that the file `google-translate.el' is somewhere on the
;; load path, add the following lines to your .emacs file:
;;
;;   (require 'google-translate)
;;   (global-set-key "\C-ct" 'google-translate-at-point)
;;   (global-set-key "\C-cT" 'google-translate-query-translate)
;;
;; Change the key bindings to your liking.


;; Customization:

;; You can customize the following variables:
;;
;; - `google-translate-enable-ido-completion'
;;
;; - `google-translate-default-source-language'
;;
;; - `google-translate-default-target-language'

;; If `google-translate-enable-ido-completion' is non-NIL, the input
;; will be read with ido-style completion.

;; If the variable `google-translate-default-source-language' is set
;; to a non-NIL value, the source language won't be queried and that
;; value will be used instead.  Analogously, if you set the variable
;; `google-translate-default-target-language' to some non-NIL value,
;; that value will be used without querying.

;; You can always override this behavior by supplying a `C-u' prefix
;; argument to the function `google-translate-query-translate'.

;; Here is an example.  Suppose that your native language is Russian
;; and you frequently need to translate from various languages to
;; Russian.  Then it is reasonable
;;
;; - to set the variable `google-translate-default-target-language'
;;   to "ru", and
;;
;; - to leave `google-translate-default-source-language' set to its
;;   default value, NIL.
;;
;; In this case, the function `google-translate-query-translate' is
;; only going to query the source language and text to translate.
;; If you need to translate to some language other than Russian, you
;; can override the default for the target language by supplying a
;; `C-u' prefix argument, in which case you will be queried for both
;; the source and target languages, as well as text to translate.

;; If you frequently translate from some fixed language, it is also
;; reasonable to set `google-translate-default-source-language' to
;; an appropriate value.
;;
;; If you have both the default source and target languages specified,
;; you may like to bind functions `google-translate-at-point-reverse'
;; and `google-translate-query-translate-reverse' to some keys, e.g.:
;;
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "C-c r") 'google-translate-at-point-reverse)
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "C-c R") 'google-translate-query-translate-reverse)
;;
;; This will allow you to quickly translate in the reverse direction.
;; When the default source (resp. target) language is not set, the
;; target (resp. source) language of the reverse translation will be
;; queried interactively.

;; The admitted values of `google-translate-default-source-language'
;; and `google-translate-default-target-language' are the codes of the
;; languages supported by Google Translate (like "ru" for Russian
;; above).  See `google-translate-supported-languages' for the list of
;; the supported languages, or customize the defaults using the
;; customization mechanism of Emacs.  Setting a default language to
;; NIL means that language will always be queried.  Moreover, the
;; variable `google-translate-default-source-language' can be set to a
;; special value "auto" that is interpreted as the instruction for
;; Google Translate to detect the source language.  This option is
;; also available when you are queried for the source language: simply
;; leave this parameter blank by pressing RET.  (If you have enabled
;; the ido-style completion, "Detect language" is going to be the
;; first option, which you can select simply by hitting RET.)

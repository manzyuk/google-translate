;;; Commentary:

;; Invoking the function `google-translate-query-translate' queries the source
;; and target languages and text to translate, and shows a buffer with
;; available translations of the text.  Invoking the function
;; `google-translate-at-point' translates the word at point or the active
;; region.

;; Installation:

;; Assuming that the file `google-translate.el' is somewhere on the
;; load path, add the following lines to your .emacs file:
;;
;;   (require 'google-translate)
;;   (global-set-key "\C-ct" 'google-translate-at-point)
;;   (global-set-key "\C-cT" 'google-translate-query-translate)
;;
;; Change the key bindings to your liking.


;; Customization:

;; You can customize the following variables:
;;
;; - `google-translate-enable-ido-completion'
;;
;; - `google-translate-default-source-language'
;;
;; - `google-translate-default-target-language'

;; If `google-translate-enable-ido-completion' is non-NIL, the input
;; will be read with ido-style completion.

;; If the variable `google-translate-default-source-language' is set
;; to a non-NIL value, the source language won't be queried and that
;; value will be used instead.  Analogously, if you set the variable
;; `google-translate-default-target-language' to some non-NIL value,
;; that value will be used without querying.

;; You can always override this behavior by supplying a `C-u' prefix
;; argument to the function `google-translate-query-translate'.

;; Here is an example.  Suppose that your native language is Russian
;; and you frequently need to translate from various languages to
;; Russian.  Then it is reasonable
;;
;; - to set the variable `google-translate-default-target-language'
;;   to "ru", and
;;
;; - to leave `google-translate-default-source-language' set to its
;;   default value, NIL.
;;
;; In this case, the function `google-translate-query-translate' is
;; only going to query the source language and text to translate.
;; If you need to translate to some language other than Russian, you
;; can override the default for the target language by supplying a
;; `C-u' prefix argument, in which case you will be queried for both
;; the source and target languages, as well as text to translate.

;; If you frequently translate from some fixed language, it is also
;; reasonable to set `google-translate-default-source-language' to
;; an appropriate value.
;;
;; If you have both the default source and target languages specified,
;; you may like to bind functions `google-translate-at-point-reverse'
;; and `google-translate-query-translate-reverse' to some keys, e.g.:
;;
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "C-c r") 'google-translate-at-point-reverse)
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "C-c R") 'google-translate-query-translate-reverse)
;;
;; This will allow you to quickly translate in the reverse direction.
;; When the default source (resp. target) language is not set, the
;; target (resp. source) language of the reverse translation will be
;; queried interactively.

;; The admitted values of `google-translate-default-source-language'
;; and `google-translate-default-target-language' are the codes of the
;; languages supported by Google Translate (like "ru" for Russian
;; above).  See `google-translate-supported-languages' for the list of
;; the supported languages, or customize the defaults using the
;; customization mechanism of Emacs.  Setting a default language to
;; NIL means that language will always be queried.  Moreover, the
;; variable `google-translate-default-source-language' can be set to a
;; special value "auto" that is interpreted as the instruction for
;; Google Translate to detect the source language.  This option is
;; also available when you are queried for the source language: simply
;; leave this parameter blank by pressing RET.  (If you have enabled
;; the ido-style completion, "Detect language" is going to be the
;; first option, which you can select simply by hitting RET.)
;;
;; The variable `google-translate-show-phonetic' controls whether the
;; phonetic spelling of the original text and its translation is
;; displayed if available.  If you want to see the phonetics, set this
;; variable to T.
;;
;; There are also three faces you can customize:
;;
;; - `google-translate-text-face', used to display the original text
;;   (defaults to `default')
;;
;; - `google-translate-phonetic-face', used to display the phonetics
;;   (defaults to `shadow')
;;
;; - `google-translate-translation-face', used to display the highest
;;   ranking translation (defaults to `default' with the `weight'
;;   attribute set to `bold')
;;
;; For example, to show the translation in a larger font change the
;; `height' attribute of the face `google-translate-translation-face'
;; like so:
;;
;;   (set-face-attribute 'google-translate-translation-face nil :height 1.4)

missing parts.  For example, a reasonable option may be to specify a
default for the target language and always be queried for the source
language.

With a `C-u' prefix argument, query the source and target languages,
even if any defaults are specified.  For example, you may frequently
need to translate from English to Russian, and you may choose to set
the default source and target languages to \"en\" and  \"ru\", resp.
However, occasionally you may also need to translate from Russian to
English.  With a `C-u' prefix argument you can override the defaults
and specify the source and target languages explicitly.

The languages are queried with completion, and the null input at the
